                A Minimalist Ruby FIR Implementation
		------------------------------------


Overview:	Instantiate an object from this tiny class
		with either the name of a CSV file and 
		optionally the row that your filter 
		coefficients come from, or simply with an
		array of your coefficients.  Make calls 
		to the next method with an incoming signal
		value, get back a filtered value.  All
		values are converted to float.  Obviously the
		basic idea here is to have the least lines
		possible for the computational kernel - 
		two whole line!  Well, some cheesy stuff
		to get it there, but oh well.

Examples:	Serially compute some filtered values:
			
		  f = FIR.new [1,2,3]

		  p f.next(1)
		  p f.next(1)
		  p f.next(1)
		  p f.next(1)
		  p f.next(1)
